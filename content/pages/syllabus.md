Effective Participation
-----------------------

Come to class having read the assigned material carefully, and prepared to listen to your classmates and engage in conversation and respectful debate with them. You will not be expected to have a brilliant insight at every moment, but do expect to voice your thoughts and interpretations, however new or unformed. We will welcome them.

Additional Expectations
-----------------------

Attendance is mandatory. If you are going to be absent you must alert me in advance. Each student will be allowed two absences, after which he or she will lose 1% (of the course total 100%) for each incident. Being late is a form of absence, and I will decide what number of late arrivals adds up to one day of absence.

Plagiarism will be heavily penalized. The Literature Faculty policy states: "students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work." Visit {{% resource_link "63357c62-cc2c-4a36-8b5e-8567cc24c37b" "Writing and Humanistic Studies" %}}.
